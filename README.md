A user can write many reviews.

Property
Represents a place listed by a host.

id – Unique identifier

title – Name or title of the property

description – Details about the property

location – Address or coordinates

pricePerNight – Cost per night

🔗 Relationships:

A property is owned by one user.

A property can have many bookings.

A property can have many reviews.

Booking
Represents a reservation made by a guest.

id – Unique identifier

userId – The guest who made the booking

propertyId – The property being booked

startDate – Check-in date

endDate – Check-out date

🔗 Relationships:

A booking belongs to one user (guest).

A booking belongs to one property.

Review
Represents feedback left by a guest after a stay.

id – Unique identifier

rating – Numeric rating (e.g., 1–5 stars)

comment – Optional text review

userId – Reviewer

propertyId – Reviewed property

🔗 Relationships:

A review is written by one user.

A review is about one property.

Payment
Represents a payment made for a booking.

### Feature Breakdown
This project replicates the essential features of Airbnb, providing a full-stack experience for users to list, browse, and book properties.

User Management
Allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts. Authentication is handled securely, and users can act as hosts or guests depending on their role.

Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete listings with details such as title, description, photos, location, and pricing. This feature allows hosts to showcase their properties to potential guests.

Booking System
Guests can select available dates and book properties with real-time availability validation. It handles date conflict checks, total cost calculation, and booking confirmation.

Search & Filters
Users can search properties by location, price range, category (e.g., beachfront, cabin), and date availability. This enhances the user experience by allowing fast and relevant discovery of listings.

Reviews and Ratings
After completing a booking, guests can leave a rating and review for the property. These reviews help future guests make informed decisions and encourage quality from hosts.

Payments Integration
Payments are securely processed using a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe). Guests can pay for their bookings, and payment status is tracked for every transaction.

Responsive Design
The application is fully responsive and mobile-friendly. Users can access all features on any device, ensuring a consistent experience across platforms.

Authentication with NextAuth
Implements secure user authentication using providers like Google or Email/Password. Sessions are handled safely with built-in protection against CSRF and other attacks.

### API Security
Securing the backend APIs is critical to ensure user safety, protect sensitive data, and prevent malicious activity. Below are the key security measures implemented in this project:

Authentication
All endpoints that handle personal or sensitive operations require user authentication. We use secure methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or NextAuth to verify user identity.
👉 Why it matters: Prevents unauthorized access and ensures that only legitimate users can interact with their own data.

Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced to differentiate between guests, hosts, and admins. Users can only access or modify data they are permitted to.
👉 Why it matters: Ensures that, for example, a guest cannot delete another user’s property or access someone else’s bookings.

Rate Limiting
Requests to the API are rate-limited using middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit or similar tools in Next.js) to prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
👉 Why it matters: Throttles excessive or automated requests to protect server resources and user experience.

Data Validation & Sanitization
All user inputs are validated and sanitized using tools like Zod or custom middleware. This helps prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
👉 Why it matters: Reduces vulnerabilities and protects the application from malicious input.

HTTPS & Secure Cookies
The app enforces HTTPS in production and uses secure, HTTP-only cookies for session management.
👉 Why it matters: Encrypts data in transit and protects session tokens from client-side access or interception.

Payment Security
Payments are processed via trusted third-party providers like Stripe, which handle PCI compliance, tokenization, and fraud protection.
👉 Why it matters: Ensures that sensitive financial data is never stored on our servers, protecting users and reducing liability.
